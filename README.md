## Inspiration
Each of us uses car rentals a lot.  

## What it does

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
1. AWS Aurora permissions restriction for accessing from Google Cloud App engine Node.js application. It took a big while to figure it out!
2. Retrieving 

## Accomplishments that I proud of

## What we learned
0. How to work _as a team_
1. How to create web apps using React framework
2. What is AWS Amplify and how to do authorization form as well as React apps using it
3. How to deploy Node.js on Google Cloud
4. How to use Google Maps speed limits API given latitude and longitude
5. How to use smartcar API
6. 

## How do we develop it further and make it an <i>truly amazing</i> application?
We are _absolutely_ motivated to improve our application and inspired by the idea! Here are some things we are already working today:
<ol>
<li>Adding reports (easy-printable PDF documents) of user's driving history with an overall rating ==> user can show it to insurance company when buying a new car and car owners can better understand his style of driving for allowing _future_ rentals</li>
<li>Involving Ethereum smart contracts that execute at a specific number of miles travelled. If a user is a good driver (based on his history) and he continues driving after the smart contract is executed, he is chared less than a bad driver. But the record about this excess still appears on the report</li>
<li>Using Google Cloud Machine learning APIs to recognize user by comparing his photo and profile picture to avoid malacious hackers</li>
<li>Showing a real-time <b>map</b> with pinned locations of all cars available (not being rented at that moment) in the database ==> information is <i>visualized</i></li>
<li>Adding multi-cryptocurrency payments using Totle API. Because paying in various cryptos <i>should not</i> be a problem for renting a car and should also be smooth and easy</li>
<li>Showing the user the <b>closest</b> cars first ==> easier to choose because the user does not want to go to another part of the city to rent a car</li>
<li>Modifying the existing system of discounts to record the number of times user exceeded the speed limit and the magnitude of this access</li>
<li>Optimizing tracking while driving to use less resources on the cloud</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
We will continue working on this project as a team. We belive perfecting it will make the world we live in today a much better place!
